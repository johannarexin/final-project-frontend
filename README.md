# Final project, ceramics site
The frontend part of my final project, a ceramic site.

Built during Technigo Boot Camp fall 2020, project 21 out of 21.

# The problem
I started with the routes, then adding the fetch to the backend (I created my own API) and finished with the styling and making the site responsive.
